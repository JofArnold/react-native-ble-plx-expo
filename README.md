As of 8.0.0 [Polidea/react-native-ble-plx](https://github.com/Polidea/react-native-ble-plx) isn't compatible with Expo 25.0.0 because of the `<React/Blah.h` imports. This is a minor fork that replaces them with `Blah.h`

I strongly suggest you don't use this as I can't gaurantee I'll keep it up to date.
